      <h2>HTML CODE</h2>
      <a href="HTML.txt" alt="HTML for Clock and Technical Report page" target ="_blank">HTML for Clock and Technical Report Page</a>

      <h2>PASSWORD PROTECTION</h2>
      <p>The password protect method I used was encryption. Using
      <a
        href="https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/"
        alt="PageCrypt - Password Protect HTML"
        >PageCrypt - Password Protect HTML</a
      >
      I was able to upload my HTML file and create a password. After clicking
      the submit button, a copy of my HTML file is downloaded onto my computer
      with new code. The new code is JavaScript. It uses the
      <a href="https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/" alt="CryptoJSlibrary"
        >CryptoJSlibrary</a
      >
      where strong encryption is implemented and cannot be bypassed.</p>


    <h2>NEW TAG</h2>
    <p>The new tag I used is <b>cite</b>. It defines the title of creative work such as a book, poem, etc. After completing research about clocks, I cited the website from where I retrieved the info. After placing the opening and closing tag around the name of the article, the text became italicize.</p>
   
    <h2>DIFFERENT WEB BROWSERS</h2>
    <p>This page displays the same the web browsers and platforms Chrome, Edge, IE and looks well on desktops/tablets/phones. </p>

    <h2>TIME SPENT</h2>
    <p>Approximately three hours was taken to complete the lab. The tasks that took the most time were hosting the page and completeing the technical report.</p>
